docs {
  Terminate an active transfer process permanently.
  
  Variables to configure:
  - transferProcessId: The transfer process ID to terminate
  - terminationReason: Human-readable reason for termination
  
  Use this to:
  - Cancel transfers that are no longer needed
  - Stop failed/stuck transfers
  - Clean up transfers with errors
  - Abort transfers started by mistake
  
  Requirements:
  - Transfer must not already be TERMINATED or COMPLETED
  - Cannot terminate already finished transfers
  
  After terminating:
  - Transfer state changes to TERMINATING â†’ TERMINATED
  - Transfer activity stops permanently
  - Cannot be resumed (unlike suspension)
  - Resources are cleaned up
  
  Note: This is permanent. Use Suspend if you might want to resume later.
