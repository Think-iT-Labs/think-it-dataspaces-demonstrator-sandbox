  Request deprovisioning of resources for a completed transfer process.
  
  Update the transferProcessId variable with the transfer process ID.
  
  Use this to:
  - Clean up provisioned resources after transfer completion
  - Release allocated resources on provider side
  - Trigger cleanup operations
  
  Typical usage:
  1. Transfer completes (state = COMPLETED)
  2. Data has been accessed/consumed
  3. Request deprovisioning to clean up
  4. Transfer moves to DEPROVISIONING â†’ DEPROVISIONED state
  
  Note: Only works on COMPLETED transfers. Some providers may auto-deprovision.
